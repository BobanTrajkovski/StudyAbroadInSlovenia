My name is Boban Trajkovski. I am 20 years old. <br><br>
 I was born in small city of Macedonia with beautiful landscapes and majestic mountains called Probistip. I was always interested in technology and phones, even had facebook page Bobi Trajkovski (Smartphones â€“ my life). 
That it is why when I had to choose what to study in my secondary school I didnt have any second thoughts about choosing my speciality. <br><br>
 I studied Electrotechnics and Automatics. That time I was more interested in cars and dreaming about working in big car company like Mercedes or Volkswagen. 
For working in such serious European companies I needed to have European dipoma. That it is how I came to idea to study in Slovenia. <br><br>
 My grandfather was working there for 10 years and I spent my childhood listening his stories about this country. He was not able to stay in Slovenia for life that is why I was feeling that it is my responsibility to settle there now. I started applying documents in different Universities of Slovenia but faces a lot of problems and difficulties. 
Not having enough level of Slovenian I couldnt understand govermental portal for applying in universities. At the same time pages in Macedonian or English were not helpful, cause there were not enough information covering each step of enrolling, as well living there, issues of accomodation and transport. Basically all information that you need when you are planning to move to another country. <br><br>
 But I succeeded and currently I am studying at University of Nova Gorica in Slovenia on bachelor programm Engineering and Management. 
Going through such experience myself I realized that I am not the only one who has such challenge in life. That it how I came to idea of creating this blog about studying in Slovenia . Here you can find any neccesary information about living in Slovenia, application in university proccess and just  my thoughts and observation. Hope you will find it useful!
